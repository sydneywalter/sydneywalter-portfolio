# Sydney Walter's Portfolio

## About Me
Hello! I'm Sydney Walter, a data scientist with expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I graduated from Lewis University in Romeoville, IL, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology. I then pursued a Master of Science in Data Science, concentrating on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

My background in life sciences, coupled with strong mathematical, critical thinking, and computer science skills, allows me to approach problems from a unique perspective. I am particularly intrigued by the vast applications of data science across various fields. The ability to extract meaningful insights from data is truly amazing, and I am excited to contribute to this dynamic field through my work and ongoing learning.
