    <h1>Sydney Walter's Portfolio</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Sydney Walter, a data scientist with expertise in 
    machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I 
    graduated from Lewis University in Romeoville, IL, where I earned my 
    Bachelor of Science in Biology. I then pursued a Master of Science in Data 
    Science, concentrating on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>My background in life sciences, coupled with strong mathematical, 
    critical thinking, and computer science skills, allows me to approach 
    problems from a unique perspective. I am particularly intrigued by the 
    vast applications of data science across various fields. The ability to 
    extract meaningful insights from data is truly amazing, and I am excited 
    to contribute to this dynamic field through my work and ongoing 
    learning.</p>
    
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>Diabetic Patient Readmission Predictive Analytics</h4>
    <p>
        This project focuses on creating a predictive model to classify 
        whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital after their 
        initial visit. The analysis involved preprocessing the data, normalizing 
        values, and using various machine learning algorithms like k-Nearest 
        Neighbors, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to identify the best 
        model.

    <h4>Developing a Predictive Model for Antidepressant Prescription Based on 
	Genetic Profiles</h4>
    <p>
        This project involves utilizing patient DNA sequences to identify 
        significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing antidepressant responses. The predictive model 
        recommends suitable antidepressants based on individual genetic 
        profiles, highlighting the potential of pharmacogenomics in 
        optimizing treatment strategies.

    <h4>Optimizing Student Performance Prediction through Various Machine 
        Learning Algorithms</h4>
    <p>
	This study investigates the use of machine learning algorithms 
	to predict student performance based on a dataset of 2,392 high school 
	students. It focuses on classifying academic outcomes into 'GradeClass' 
	categories using Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. The Neural 
	Network model outperformed the Logistic Regression model, achieving an 
	accuracy of 82.67%, indicating its greater effectiveness for this 
	classification task.
