       "797  This association is for response at week 4 but not at week 12.  The allele associated with worse response is described as G.  This is a G/C SNP, so this is ambiguous.  The gene is on the negative chromosomal strand, so I am guessing that the authors meant negative chromosomal strand G (= positive chromosomal strand C).  The OR entered is for increased risk of non-response.  Authors note that Bonferroni correction was not done and that they think that it would be overly conservative to do so.  p entered is not corrected; 7 SNPs were tested. Number of \"cases\" and \"controls\" entered are responders and non-responders.   \n",

The allele associated with worse response is described as G.  This is a G/C SNP, so this is ambiguous.  The gene is on the negative chromosomal strand, so I am guessing that the authors meant negative chromosomal strand G (= positive chromosomal strand C).  The OR entered is for increased risk of non-response.  Authors note that Bonferroni correction was not done and that they think that it would be overly conservative to do so.  p entered is not corrected; 7 SNPs were tested. Number of \"cases\" and \"controls\" entered are responders and non-responders.   \n",
