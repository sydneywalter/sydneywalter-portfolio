# Developing a Predictive Model for Antidepressant Prescription Based on 
Genetic Profiles

## Abstract
Advancements in genetic sequencing have revolutionized the treatment 
approach for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), emphasizing personalized 
medicine guided by genetic profiles. This study utilized patient DNA 
sequences to identify significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
influencing antidepressant responses and side effects, integrating them 
with reference sequences to optimize treatment strategies.

Genetic profiling of simulated patients revealed associations between 
specific variants and treatment outcomes, aligning with existing 
literature. For instance, variants such as rs762551 in Cytochrome P450 1A 
(CYP1A2) were linked to increased fatigue risk and altered medication 
requirements. From these patient profiles, a predictive algorithm was 
developed to recommend the most suitable antidepressant based on 
individual genetic profiles.

This study underscores the potential of pharmacogenomics to refine 
antidepressant therapy through personalized genetic insights, while 
acknowledging current limitations. Further research encompassing broader 
genetic landscapes promises to advance precision psychiatry, optimizing 
therapeutic interventions and patient care outcomes.
