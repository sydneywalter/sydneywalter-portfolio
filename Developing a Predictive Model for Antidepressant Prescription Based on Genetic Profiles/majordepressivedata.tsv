In children with either major depressive disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder taking paroxetine 10 mg/day, extensive 'high' CYP2D6 metabolizers showed much higher clearance compared to other CYP2D6 phenotypes; however, at doses of 20 and 30 mg/day this difference in clearance was not seen. Phenotypes for diplotypes were defined as: extensive 'high' metabolizers = activity score of 1.75 or more, extensive 'medium' = 1.5, extensive 'low' = 1-1.25, intermediate metabolizers = 0.5-0.75, poor metabolizers= 0.

Genotype determination by RFLP for a patient describe in PMID: 4082245. Patient was previously phenotyped with debrisoquine and a extremely rapid hydroxylator phenotype was determined for this patient. Patient received high doses of nortriptyline with no improvement of depression symptoms. Patient received 300-500mg/day to reach therapeutic plasma levels 200-600nM. Receiving a daily dose of 300mg/day led to NT plasma levels of 210-350nM and hydroxy-NT levels of 2730nM.
