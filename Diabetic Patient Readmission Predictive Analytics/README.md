# Diabetic Patient Readmission Predictive Analytics

This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether 
diabetic patients will be readmitted to the hospital after their initial 
visit. By analyzing a decade of clinical care data, I used machine 
learning algorithms to create a model that identifies key factors 
influencing the likelihood of readmission.

## Project Files
- **[Project Report

A detailed report on the project's methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **[Orange Canvas Code (OWS)](diabetes%20classify%20readmission.ows):** 
The code used to create the predictive model.
- **[Dataset (CSV)](diabetic_data.csv):** The dataset used for this 
analysis.

## Project Summary
The dataset contains information from 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical 
care data from 130 United States hospitals, focused on diabetic patients. 
The analysis identified key features such as medications administered, lab 
tests performed, and other relevant attributes. Using Random Forest, 
k-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression, the model was built and 
evaluated, with Random Forest showing the best performance.

## Conclusion
The predictive model developed in this project provides a valuable tool 
for identifying high-risk diabetic patients. This can assist healthcare 
providers in taking preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of 
readmission, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
