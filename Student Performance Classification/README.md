# Optimizing Student Performance Prediction through Various Machine 
Learning Algorithms

## Sydney Walter

## Abstract
This study investigates the predictive modeling of student performance 
using a comprehensive dataset of 2,392 high school students. The objective 
is to classify students' academic outcomes into distinct 'GradeClass' 
categories based on demographic, behavioral, and academic features. Two 
machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression and Neural Networks—are 
employed to develop predictive models. The Logistic Regression model 
achieved an accuracy of 76%, highlighting strengths in Class 4 
classifications but difficulties with Classes 1 and 2. Conversely, the 
Neural Network model demonstrated improved performance, achieving an 
accuracy of 82.67%, with particularly strong results for Class 4. The 
findings indicate that while both models exhibit effectiveness in 
predicting student performance, the Neural Network model outperforms 
Logistic Regression, suggesting its suitability for this classification 
task. The study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in 
educational contexts and outlines areas for future improvement, including 
model refinement and feature engineering.
